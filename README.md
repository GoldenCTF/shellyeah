OBS: not all shells are tested.
all shells from the list should be generated to a file in the directory typed in the script.
the msfvenom entry should generate a exe or elf file as if you typed out the whole command.

Any issues can be submitted and i'll look into it / fix it.

I primarily wrote this script to get my hands wet with python. if you like it or find it usefull I would be happy.
